HELLO WORLD!

CERTAINLY! LET'S BREAK DOWN THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PROVIDED C++ PROGRAM:

COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS:
CPP
COPY CODE
INT MAIN(INT ARGC, CHAR* ARGV[]) {
THE MAIN FUNCTION TAKES COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS. ARGC IS THE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS, AND ARGV IS AN ARRAY OF STRINGS CONTAINING THE ARGUMENTS. THE PROGRAM EXPECTS TWO ARGUMENTS: THE INPUT FILE NAME (ARGV[1]) AND THE OUTPUT FILE NAME (ARGV[2]).
FILE HANDLING:
CPP
COPY CODE
CONST CHAR* INPUTFILENAME = ARGV[1];
CONST CHAR* OUTPUTFILENAME = ARGV[2];

STD::IFSTREAM INPUTFILE(INPUTFILENAME);
STD::OFSTREAM OUTPUTFILE(OUTPUTFILENAME);
THE PROGRAM USES STD::IFSTREAM FOR INPUT AND STD::OFSTREAM FOR OUTPUT. IT OPENS THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS.
READING AND PROCESSING LINES:
CPP
COPY CODE
STD::STRING LINE;
STD::SIZE_T TOTALCHARACTERS = 0;

WHILE (STD::GETLINE(INPUTFILE, LINE)) {
    // CONVERT THE LINE TO UPPERCASE
    FOR (CHAR& C : LINE) {
        C = STD::TOUPPER(C);
    }

    // WRITE THE UPPERCASE LINE TO THE OUTPUT FILE
    OUTPUTFILE << LINE << '\N';

    // UPDATE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
    TOTALCHARACTERS += LINE.SIZE();
}
THE PROGRAM READS THE INPUT FILE LINE BY LINE USING STD::GETLINE. FOR EACH LINE, IT CONVERTS THE CHARACTERS TO UPPERCASE USING STD::TOUPPER AND WRITES THE MODIFIED LINE TO THE OUTPUT FILE. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IS ALSO ACCUMULATED.
