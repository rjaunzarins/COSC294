Hello World!

Certainly! Let's break down the key components of the provided C++ program:

Command-line Arguments:
cpp
Copy code
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
The main function takes command-line arguments. argc is the number of arguments, and argv is an array of strings containing the arguments. The program expects two arguments: the input file name (argv[1]) and the output file name (argv[2]).
File Handling:
cpp
Copy code
const char* inputFileName = argv[1];
const char* outputFileName = argv[2];

std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName);
std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName);
The program uses std::ifstream for input and std::ofstream for output. It opens the input and output files specified in the command-line arguments.
Reading and Processing Lines:
cpp
Copy code
std::string line;
std::size_t totalCharacters = 0;

while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {
    // Convert the line to uppercase
    for (char& c : line) {
        c = std::toupper(c);
    }

    // Write the uppercase line to the output file
    outputFile << line << '\n';

    // Update the total number of characters
    totalCharacters += line.size();
}
The program reads the input file line by line using std::getline. For each line, it converts the characters to uppercase using std::toupper and writes the modified line to the output file. The total number of characters is also accumulated.
