1. Create new folder in COSC2947 (right click below folders listed below COSC2947 in VS code)
2. Create new .cpp file in the new folder
For first time running file (Terminal > configure default build task and ensure its correct)
After file has been compiled like this you can copy the code to recompile file at any time
3. Terminal > Run Build Task
4. Click + above zsh things in bottom right
5. cd to folder you created (if the name of the folder doesnt show on new zsh created)
6. ls to make sure all the files are there
7. ./filename to run the file


example of configure default build task line:
/usr/bin/clang++ -std=c++20 -stdlib=libc++ -g /Users/rhy/Desktop/Workspace/COSC2947/Lab1/lab1.cpp -o /Users/rhy/Desktop/Workspace/COSC2947/Lab1/lab1
